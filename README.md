I am a junior in highschool that spends long hours on school work. I have club every Friday, and do community service from time to time. I will be taking the SAT's this year, therefore I will be applying for a SAT prep class. I live far from school, so making afterschool commitments are hard, but I still want to try. I hope to face all of this years challenges open-mindly, and at the same time still stay sincere.
